## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "withOpacity is deprecated"
**Solution:** These are just warnings in Flutter 3.9+. The app works perfectly. To fix, replace `.withOpacity()` with `.withValues()` if needed.

### Issue: App crashes on first launch
**Solution:** Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Issue: SharedPreferences not working
**Solution:** This is a known iOS simulator issue sometimes. Test on a real device or Android emulator.

### Issue: Fonts not loading
**Solution:** Run `flutter pub get` again and restart the app.
